This is a JSON generator for TimelineJS data. It lets you put in JSON files and it converts them to the format used by TimelineJS (found at http://timeline.verite.co). 

To install TimelineGen:
gem install timelinegen


To use TimelineGen:
t = TimelineGen.new(json input, "name of fields to pull headlines from", "name of field for main text", "name of field for start date", "name of field for end date", "timeline title")
t.timeline

If you want multiple fields from the JSON to show up in a single field on the timeline, just put a comma between the field names.


Example-
The following generates a timeline with data from the email.json file. 
The subject of the emails is the headline, the sender, recipient, and email body are the main text on the timeline, the start date is the send date, and there is no end date.
The whole timeline will be labeled Email Timeline.

t = TimelineGen.new(File.read("emails.json"), "subject", "to, from, body", "date", nil, "Email Timeline")
t.timeline
