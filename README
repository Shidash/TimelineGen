This is a JSON generator for TimelineJS data. It lets you put in JSON files and it converts them to the format used by TimelineJS (found at http://timeline.verite.co). 

To install TimelineGen:
gem install timelinegen

To use TimelineGen, add this at the top of your files:
require 'timelinegen'


TimelineGen.genTimeline(event) 

The method for generating a full timeline. It takes an array of JSON data as input.


TimelineGen.genEvent(startDate, endDate, headline, text) 

The method for generating JSON data for an event. It takes a start date, end date, headline, and text for input. All of these are strings.


TimelineGen.parseDate(date)
 
This method takes a date in the form of string like 2011-11-15 18:05:01 for input and converts it to the format used by TimelineJS. genEvent also calls this.
