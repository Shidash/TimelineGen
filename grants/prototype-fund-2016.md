### What open source projects you have worked with so far? 

*Max. 3 Showcases specify with links*

From 2013 to 2015 I co-founded, fundraised, and was the sole designer of the Mailpile which project focused on bringing usable PGP encryption to email. I also performed software engineering duties for all interface related aspects. https://mailpile.is

In early 2015 I helped bootstrap the Open Source Design community which is a group of contributors bringing good design and usability to open source projects via a "jobs" board that is run 100% transparently using GitHub repositories and is entirely open for anyone to participate http://opensourcedesign.net

In spring 2015 I joined Transparency Toolkit as a designer and software developer. I have worked on our suite of open source tools that collect and visualize open source intelligence data from various sources. I also collaborated with Amnesty International security researcher Claudio Guarnieri to create the DigitalFreedom.io which is data catalog powered by Open Knowledge Foundations "data packages". Both projects are aimed at exposing human rights abuses and unlawful surveillance against civil society https://transparencytoolkit.org/projects/

### Project Title

Thumbtack

### What problem do you want with your project solve? What was your motivation? 

*1000 chars*

Almost all news published in paper form and on the internet are text based narratives like "who did what, where, when, to whom, and why". Presently, we see far more articles in volume but with shorter content length and bad fact checking due to small budgets. The truth is getting harder to ascertain. Additionally, the increasingly fast pace of internet publishing and social media, another problem that emerges is information overload. Consider, multiple publications with differing views and biases report on the same topic or event. What commonly happens is Publication A will omit one fact, while Publication B will embellish a supporting non-fact, and Publication C will present a hard fact that is contradictory of the other two points. Meanwhile, a source may confirm the inaccuracy as reported by Publication A and B on Twitter but the original articles will never be updated and people may never learn the truth as Publication C is less popular. All of these factors put accuracy and integrity of news at risk, which make the public vulnerable to persausion and propaganda from both governments and corporations.

### How will your project solve this problem? 

*2000 chars*

Thumbtack is an open source narrative mapping tool that solves the problem of falsified, dubious, and contradictory stories as well as helps with information overload by providing an overview interface that corroborates narratives across multiple sources and formats. 

Traditional journalism starts with a lead for a story, then progresses to collecting information from sources to produce a narrative. The final stage is writing to accurately convey the truth. Good journalism contains numerous citations to source material such as documents, emails, or coroborated quotations from interviews. ThumbTack is an open source web application can be used by a solo journalist or part of a collaborative crowd sourced effort to collect information that can verified and fact checked at all times. Thumbtack allows users to submit evidence and citations from raw source material as well as verifiable facts gleened from already published articles across differing versions of a story (e.g. multiple publications) and numerous media formats or sources (e.g. news posts, leaked documents, archives, RSS feeds, Twitter, and other web APIs).

The result of all data input into ThumbTack will be a timeline based data visualization of interconnected events. Imagine a hybrid of a line graph mashed together with a geographic map like Google Maps. The horizontal axis will display a chronological timeline of events while the vertical axis will display a "depth of information" that can be zoomed into. In Google Maps where you zoom from Country to City to Neighborhood, in Thumbtack users can zoom from Point 1 to supporting Point 2, to Point 3 which is a verifiable document or testimony. Each point will be weighted in either an affirmative or negative direction and also give more weight to verifiable evidence over hearsay or uncoroborated testimony. The fully zoomed out view of a narrative will make it easy to get an accurate and truthful overview without having to read through numerous articles and source documents and try ascertain the truth.

### Who is the target audience? As it benefits from the project?

*2000 chars*

Depending on the given use case ThumbTack has two target audiences. The first audience is solo and teams of journalists working on stories who will benefit from an intuitive and easy to use interface that helps them keep track of collected data points and narratives. The second audience will be the general public who is browsing the internet and is interested in current world events that revolve around complicated narratives.

By design, Thumbtack will support open data formats whenever possible so as to integrate with other tools and platforms. Implemented correctly, an additional use case will be that Thumbtack timelines can be embedded or offered as companion pieces alongside traditional articles, similar to how DocumentCloud offers source documents with highlighted notations.

An example case could be: "Is encryption helping terrorists by making it harder for intelligence agencies to do their work?" If you ask people in the general public, who have very little knowledge on the subject of encryption, there is a popular opinion that encryption is definitely a problem for government agencies. However, if you ask privacy advocates and computer security experts, both groups will quickly recite numerous facts from recent attacks in Europe claiming that encryption is mostly irrelevant as terrorists didn't even use it to plan their operations. Thus, failure to stop the attacks stemmed from other failures of intellgence gathering and analysis. 

Using Thumbtack, each of the sentences in the previous paragraph and their subsequent claims can be cited with supporting and verifiable evidence which drills down to the lower points (e.g. Point 2 and Point 3) thus offering a more comprehensive and truthful picture of events as outlined and described at the highest level points (e.g. Point 1). Narratives that are published publicly will be of benefit to the public record and will help to create a more well informed society.

### Have you ever been working on the idea? If so, briefly describe the current state and explain the new feature.

*1000 chars, links*

At present I have only performed a small amount of work towards the Thumbtack application. Of this work, I have created early drawings and sketches and I will be creating preliminary wireframe designs in the coming weeks. I have also started to collect test data that is based on the narrative outlined above "encryption and terrorist attacks". I will be uploading design renderings and data to the following repositories:

https://github.com/TransparencyToolkit/Thumbtack/
https://github.com/TransparencyToolkit/EncryptionTerrorism-Data

However, at Transparency Toolkit myself and my colleague M.C. McGrath plan to make Thumbtack work alongside our existing pipeline and tools that we have created. The most relevant tool is called Harvester which deals with collecting and processing of open data. All of our tools are described technically here:

https://github.com/TransparencyToolkit/Project

Thumbtack will be able to use data collected from Harvester as well the full-text search capabilities of LookingGlass.
